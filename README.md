The project was created inside of eclipse using Java 8 on Windows 10. <br />

Download the GitHub repository as a .zip and extract the contents of the archive anywhere.<br />

To compile the project you must compile the .java files using the Java Compiler. This can be done by downloading the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) from:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html <br />

My Java compiler was found under: <br />

"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_111\bin\javac.exe" <br />

The program was compiled using the following command (ensure that you have navigated to a folder that contains both ClosestUserEvents.java and Events.java): <br />

"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_111\bin\javac.exe" ClosestUserEvents.java <br />

It was then executed using (Note: the lack of .class at the end of the file): <br />

java ClosestUserEvents <br />

# Example output: <br />

Please Input Coordinates: <br />
5,-7 <br />
Closest Events to (5,-7): <br />
Event 98 - $198.72, Distance 0 <br />
Event 104 - $28.06, Distance 1 <br />
Event 105 - $38.55, Distance 3 <br />
Event 110 - $196.61, Distance 4 <br />
Event 114 - $154.53, Distance 4 <br />
